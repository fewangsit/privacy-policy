        <p class="tagline">
          This Privacy Policy explains how App Internal ("we", "our", or "us")
          collects, uses, and protects information when you use our Kotlin
          Multiplatform application for Android and iOS.

        <h2>1. Scope & Acceptance</h2>
        <p>
          By installing or using the Services, you acknowledge that you have
          read and understood this Policy. If you do not agree with it, please
          uninstall the app and discontinue use.

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <h3>2.1 Information you provide directly</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Account and profile data</strong> such as name, email
            address, organization, or role when supplied for authentication or
            personalization.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Support requests</strong> including the contents of
            messages, attachments, and diagnostics you voluntarily send to us.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2.2 Information collected automatically</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Usage and diagnostics</strong> from Firebase Analytics,
            Crashlytics, and our Kermit logging stack (e.g., feature usage, app
            version, timestamp, stability metrics).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Device data</strong> such as model, operating system,
            language, time zone, advertising identifiers, and network status.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Log data</strong> captured via Ktor client logging and
            DataStore to detect errors, latency, and security anomalies.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2.3 Platform-specific sensors & permissions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Location</strong> data via Compass (precise GPS coordinates
            or derived geofences) when you grant permission for location-aware
            workflows.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Camera, QR/Barcode, and media</strong> using Wangs Camera
            and EasyQRScan for scanning codes or capturing documents; media is
            processed locally unless you initiate an upload.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Photos & Files</strong> when you choose to import
            attachments or screenshots; we only access the items you explicitly
            select.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2.4 Data from integrations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Backend APIs</strong> consumed via Ktor may provide account
            metadata, attendance records, or configuration necessary to deliver
            the Services.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Third-party SDKs</strong> (Google Play Services, Firebase,
            Google Maps/Location APIs) may receive device identifiers needed to
            operate.

      <section class="card">
        <h2>4. Sharing & Disclosure</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Service providers</strong> such as Firebase, Google Cloud,
            or managed hosting partners that process data on our behalf under
            contractual safeguards.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Business operations</strong> including affiliates within the

            <strong>Legal compliance</strong> when required by applicable law,
            regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request.

          <li>
            <strong>Business transfers</strong> in connection with a merger,

      <section class="card">
        <h2>5. Data Storage & Retention</h2>
        <p>
          Data is stored securely using Google Cloud (Firebase) regions
          appropriate to your deployment. We retain information only as long as
          necessary for the purposes outlined in this Policy, unless a longer
          retention period is required by law or internal compliance
          obligations. You may request deletion, and we will remove data unless
          retention is mandated.

      <section class="card">
        <h2>6. Security</h2>
        <p>
          We implement industry-standard safeguards, including TLS encryption
          for network calls (via Ktor), scoped platform permissions, secure
          keystores, access controls, and continuous monitoring. However, no
          system is perfectly secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute
          protection. Please notify us promptly if you suspect unauthorized
          access.

            data we hold.

            required.

          <li>
            <strong>Permission controls:</strong> Use system settings to revoke
            location, camera, microphone, or notification access; core features
            may degrade.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Marketing opt-out:</strong> Disable in-app communications or
            contact us to adjust preferences.

          Depending on your jurisdiction (e.g., GDPR, PDPA, CCPA), you may have

        <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>
          Because we operate globally, your information may be processed in
          countries outside your own. We rely on safeguard mechanisms such as
          Standard Contractual Clauses or equivalent legal bases to ensure
          adequate protection.

          The Services are not directed to children under 13 (or the age
          required by local law). We do not knowingly collect personal data from
          children. If you believe a child has provided data, contact us to
          remove it.
