# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: November 17, 2025_

This Privacy Policy explains how App Internal ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and protects information when you use our Kotlin Multiplatform application for Android and iOS. By installing or using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Policy. If you do not agree, please uninstall the app and discontinue use.

## 1. Scope & Acceptance

By accessing or using the Services, you consent to the practices described here. If you disagree with any part of the Policy, you should stop using the Services immediately.

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Information you provide directly

- **Account and profile data** such as name, email address, organization, or role when supplied for authentication or personalization.
- **Support requests** including the contents of messages, attachments, and diagnostics you voluntarily send to us.

### 2.2 Information collected automatically

- **Usage and diagnostics** from Firebase Analytics, Crashlytics, and our Kermit logging stack (e.g., feature usage, app version, timestamp, stability metrics).
- **Device data** such as model, operating system, language, time zone, advertising identifiers, and network status.
- **Log data** captured via Ktor client logging and DataStore to detect errors, latency, and security anomalies.

### 2.3 Platform-specific sensors & permissions

- **Location** data via Compass (precise GPS coordinates or derived geofences) when you grant permission for location-aware workflows.
- **Camera, QR/Barcode, and media** using Wangs Camera and EasyQRScan for scanning codes or capturing documents; media is processed locally unless you initiate an upload.
- **Photos & Files** when you choose to import attachments or screenshots; we only access the items you explicitly select.

### 2.4 Data from integrations

- **Backend APIs** consumed via Ktor may provide account metadata, attendance records, or configuration necessary to deliver the Services.
- **Third-party SDKs** (Google Play Services, Firebase, Google Maps/Location APIs) may receive device identifiers needed to operate.

## 3. How We Use Information

- Deliver core functionality such as authentication, attendance submission, QR validation, and location-based workflows.
- Provide customer support, respond to requests, and troubleshoot issues using diagnostics and crash reports.
- Monitor performance, enhance stability, and prioritize features through aggregated analytics.
- Enforce security policies, prevent fraud, and comply with legal obligations.
- Personalize notifications, content, or configurations based on your environment flavor (development vs. production).

## 4. Sharing & Disclosure

- **Service providers** such as Firebase, Google Cloud, or managed hosting partners that process data on our behalf under contractual safeguards.
- **Business operations** including affiliates within the ASDF group who help deliver administrative or technical services.
- **Legal compliance** when required by applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request.
- **Business transfers** in connection with a merger, acquisition, restructuring, or sale of assets, provided the recipient honors this Policy.
- We do **not** sell personal data to third parties for advertising or marketing.

## 5. Data Storage & Retention

Data is stored securely using Google Cloud (Firebase) regions appropriate to your deployment. We retain information only as long as necessary for the purposes outlined in this Policy, unless a longer retention period is required by law or internal compliance obligations. You may request deletion, and we will remove data unless retention is mandated.

## 6. Security

We implement industry-standard safeguards, including TLS encryption for network calls (via Ktor), scoped platform permissions, secure keystores, access controls, and continuous monitoring. However, no system is perfectly secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection. Please notify us promptly if you suspect unauthorized access.

## 7. Your Rights & Choices

- **Access & Portability:** Request a copy of personal data we hold.
- **Correction:** Update inaccurate or incomplete information.
- **Deletion:** Ask us to erase data that is no longer required.
- **Permission controls:** Use system settings to revoke location, camera, microphone, or notification access; core features may degrade.
- **Marketing opt-out:** Disable in-app communications or contact us to adjust preferences.

Depending on your jurisdiction (e.g., GDPR, PDPA, CCPA), you may have additional rights. We will honor requests within the timelines mandated by applicable law.

## 8. International Data Transfers

Because we operate globally, your information may be processed in countries outside your own. We rely on safeguard mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses or equivalent legal bases to ensure adequate protection.

## 9. Children’s Privacy

The Services are not directed to children under 13 (or the age required by local law). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided data, contact us to remove it.

## 10. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Policy to reflect product, legal, or regulatory changes. We will post the revised version with a new "Last updated" date and, where appropriate, provide additional notice within the app.

## 11. Contact Us

If you have questions, concerns, or wish to exercise your privacy rights, contact us at [support@asdf.id](mailto:support@asdf.id). Please include sufficient detail to help us verify your identity and respond quickly.
